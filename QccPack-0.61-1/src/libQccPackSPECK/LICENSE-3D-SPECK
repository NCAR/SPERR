Public License for the 3D-SPECK Algorithm
Version 1.0, April 30, 2004

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 3D Set-Partitioning Embedded Block (SPECK) algorithm is protected by
US Patent #6,671,413 (issued December 30, 2003) and by patents pending.
An implementation of the 3D-SPECK algorithm is included herein with the
gracious permission of Dr. William A. Pearlman, exclusive holder of patent
rights. Dr. Pearlman has granted the following license governing the terms
and conditions for use, copying, distribution, and modification of the
3D-SPECK algorithm implementation contained herein (hereafter referred to
as "the 3D-SPECK source code").

0. Use of the 3D-SPECK source code, including any executable-program or
   linkable-library form resulting from its compilation, is restricted to
   solely academic or non-commercial research activities.

1. Any other use, including, but not limited to, use in the development
   of a commercial product, use in a commercial application, or commercial

   or modifications of the 3D-SPECK source code.

NO WARRANTY

3. Dr. Pearlman dislaims all warranties, expressed or implied, including
   without limitation any warranty whatsoever as to the fitness for a
   particular use or the merchantability of the 3D-SPECK source code.

4. In no event shall Dr. Pearlman be liable for any loss of profits, loss
   of business, loss of use or loss of data, nor for indirect, special,
   incidental or consequential damages of any kind related to use of the
   3D-SPECK source code.
