## Overview

SPERR (pronounced like *spur*) is a lossy compressor for scientific data (2D or 3D floating-point data, mostly produced by numerical simulations). 
SPERR has one of the highest coding efficiencies among popular lossy compressors, meaning that it usually uses the least amount of storage
to satisfy a prescribed error tolerance (e.g., a maximum point-wise error tolerance).


Under the hood, SPERR uses wavelet transforms, [SPECK](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1347192) coding, 
and a custom outlier coding algorithm in its compression pipeline. 
This combination gives SPERR flexibility to compress targetting different quality controls, namely 1) bit-per-pixel (BPP), 
2) peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and 3) point-wise error (PWE).
The name of SPERR stands for **SP**eck with **ERR**or bounding.

## Quick Build
SPERR requires 1) a working C++ compiler and 2) CMake tools to build. On a Unix-like system,
the build steps are the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR.git # clone the repo
mkdir SPERR/build                           # create the build directory
cd SPERR/build                              # enter the build directory
cmake ..                                    # Linux: use cmake to configure the project (with OpenMP)
cmake -DUSE_OMP=OFF ..                      # Mac: use cmake to configure the project (OpenMP disabled)
make -j 8                                   # build the project
ctest .                                     # run unit tests, which should have 100% tests passed
make install                                # install the library and CLI tools to a designated directory.
```

## Plugin for HDF5
SPERR is available as a *dynamically loaded plugin* for HDF5. This plugin is available at this [repo](https://github.com/NCAR/H5Z-SPERR).

## Documentation

SPERR documentation is hosted on Github [Wiki](https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/wiki) pages. To get started, one might want to
[build SPERR from source](https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/wiki/Build-SPERR-From-Source) and explore compression and decompression
utilities for [3D and 2D](https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/wiki/CLI%3A-3D-and-2D-Compression-and-Decompression-Utilities) inputs.
One can also use [spack](https://spack.io/) to install SPERR by a single command `spack install sperr`.
Finally, a collection of canonical scientific data sets is available at [SDRBench](https://sdrbench.github.io/) for testing and evaluation purposes.

SPERR also provides programming [API in C++ and C](https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/wiki#sperr-c-api).
