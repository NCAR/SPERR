## Custom Filter Support In SPERR

SPERR supports a custom filter to be placed in its data processing pipeline. 
This filter is invoked before any SPERR-defined data compression steps (e.g., wavelet
transform, outlier correction), and is also invoked as the last step of data *decompression*.
As an example, [Matthias_Filter.h]((https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile)) 
here performs two operation: 1) calculate mean of a slice
and subtract mean for every value of that slice; and 2) calculate RMS of a slice and divide
every value by the RMS.


## Use A Custom Filter

To use a custom filter, one needs to bring the filter implementation to the SPERR compilation.
Once SPERR is compiled with a filter, SPERR will always include the filter in its data processing
pipeline. In other words, there is no API to enable/disable the filter.

There are four steps to bring a filter implementation to the SPERR compilation:
(use `Matthias_Filter` here as an example)

1. Copy the implementation files to their respective directories. For example, copy `Matthias_Filter.h` 
   to the `include` directory, and `Matthias_Filter.cpp` to the `src` directory.
2. Include the implementation files in `src/CMakeLists.txt`. For example, uncomment the following two
   lines.
3. Specify to use the custom filter in `include/Conditioner.h`. For example.

## Implement A Custom Filter

Implement a custom filter requires creating a custom filter class inherited from a
[Base_Filter](https://github.com/NCAR/SPERR/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile), and also 
implementing three mandatory functions:
```C++
virtual auto apply_filter(vecd_type& buf, dims_type dims) -> vec8_type;
virtual auto inverse_filter(vecd_type&, dims_type, const void* header, size_t header_len) -> bool;
virtual auto header_size(const void* header) const -> size_t
```
The custom filter is free to implement any other non-mandatory functions.
